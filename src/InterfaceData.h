/**
 * @brief This class implements the data model for the interface.txt
 * file.
 *
 * The interface.txt is considered to be a list of BIND token with child
 * token. A BIND token has three values: '[BIND:<action>:<repeat_mode>]'.
 * BIND token are merged in a similar way to init files. Child token are
 * added to the corresponding BIND token. They can be hidden with a
 * DELETE token ('[DELETE:KEY:'a']' will hide '[KEY:'a']').
